# odin-rockpaperscissors
A basic rock/paper/scissors game for The Odin Project in the theme of Dungeons & Dragons. Play Dragon, Tarrasque, Kraken with an evil lich lord and see who prevails.

## Technologies
CSS + HTML for site look, JavaScript for computing outcome of the game and frontend design.

## Objectives
To make a functional Rock/Paper/Scissors game with a functional UI so that players can play in a more intuitive way.

## Lessons Learned
My first version of this project focused more on the code of the game. I made a version where you could select the number of rounds to play out of (out of 3, 5, etc) and it would not only play those games, but end the game early if one side was too far behind to come back. It was an interesting challenge, but in the second iteration I opted for a simpler mode (first to 5 wins) so I could focus more on the UI. I refined my basic JavaScript skills in implementing the game, but also learned a lot about CSS in designing the UI, which I am quite proud of even though it is minimalist. Because I did the second iteration of this project a couple months after the first, I also learned to refactor code I had previously written, and I was very satisfied with my comments and code readability.
